# Intranet
This is Intranet web application designed and developed for IOCL Rajasthan.

The site was created single handed as I was getting more familiar with different aspects of web development. I used ASP.NET/C# to develop it and used Access database as a storage place for dynamic content. 

Key features of Intranet:
-------------------------------
1. Single window access to common types of documents, links and information.
2. Department wise pages for sharing information to department's employees.
3. Admin right to each department's head for uploading new files or delete existing files.
4. Automatic AD and Window authentication for admin and non-admin users.
5. IT department's admin can grant admin rights to department's user. 
6. IT department's admin can upload or delete shared files for all users.
7. IT department's admin can set notification message on Intranet for all users.
8. Automatic error handling and logging for all pages.
9. Intranet users can view pdf and excel files in the browser itself.
10. Users can see the online gallery of different events and functions.
